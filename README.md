Some experimenting I did with cellular automata in Godot 3.5.  This includes a way to generate Wolfram's 1D automata, as well as an implementation of Wireworld and the Game of Life (which has a cool camera zoom).  I also was playing with a particle-based AL system, but didn't get too far with it.  I'm sorry about the state of the documentation, this wasn't meant for anyone but me, but maybe you can have some fun learning and playing around with it.
